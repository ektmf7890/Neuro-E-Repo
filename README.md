# NeuroE
Source code for deep learning computer vision software implemented in C++ and Qt. A GUI desktop application that utilizes pre-trained deep learning models to perform computer
vision tasks including classification, object detection, segmentation, and anomoly detection. 

Images as well as videos with specific formats are available for inference and inference time varies depending on image size and the model type. SQLite database manages image
data and inference results to provide statistics of normal/anomaly products when deployed to production lines.
